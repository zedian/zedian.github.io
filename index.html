            I am a second year Computer Science MS student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. I build trustworthy and scalable language technologies that improve our everyday lives. My current focus is in developing conversational agents that really understand you.

            I am fortunate to have worked with many wonderful collaborators and mentors. At Stanford, I improved the robustness of natural language technologies to dialectal variations under <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html">Diyi Yang</a>. Prior to my graduate studies, I researched drug and protein language models to expedite the drug discovery process supervised by <a href="https://bigaidream.github.io/">Jie Fu</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html">Xue (Steve) Liu</a>. I have also worked a lot on efficient machine learning. With <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/masoud-asgharian">Masoud Asgharian</a>, I worked on an estimator for intrinsic dimension. Later, I developed numerical precision bounds for floating-point quantized neural networks with <a href="https://datawisdom.ca/">Vahid Partovi Nia</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academia, I built graph neural network solutions at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon</a>, machine learning infrastructure at <a href="https://intactlab.ca/">Intact</a>, and conversational agents at UMAknow.

            In my free time, you can find me mastering the art of coffee brewing, refining my wine palate, enjoying sports  with friends (&#127939; &#127955; &#128378; &#129495; &#9968;), and capturing moments with my camera.
